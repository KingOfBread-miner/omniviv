# Omniviv API Configuration

# CORS configuration
# For development, enable permissive mode (allows all origins)
cors_permissive: true
# For production, disable permissive and specify allowed origins:
# cors_permissive: false
# cors_origins:
#   - "https://your-domain.com"

# Areas to fetch OSM data from
# Each area is defined by a bounding box (south, west, north, east)
areas:
  - name: "Augsburg"
    # Greater Augsburg area bounding box
    bounding_box:
      south: 48.20
      west: 10.75
      north: 48.48
      east: 11.05
    # Public transport types to fetch
    transport_types:
      - tram
      # - bus  # Disabled temporarily - too many stops overwhelm Overpass API

# EFA API departure sync configuration
# Controls how often and how much data is fetched from the EFA API.
# Higher limit/timeSpan with longer interval = fewer requests but same coverage.
efa_sync:
  # Seconds between departure sync cycles (default: 60)
  interval_secs: 60
  # Max departures/arrivals per stop per request (default: 30)
  limit_per_stop: 30
  # Time window in minutes to query (default: 60)
  # Larger values return more events per request, reducing polling frequency needs.
  time_span_minutes: 60
  # Max concurrent EFA API requests (default: 10)
  max_concurrent_requests: 10
  # Also fetch arrivals (doubles request count if true) (default: true)
  fetch_arrivals: true
